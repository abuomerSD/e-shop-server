🛒 E-Commerce REST API (Improved Version)

This project is an improved and expanded version of my previous e-commerce backend.
It is built using Node.js, Express, and Sequelize ORM, with a strong focus on clean architecture, validation, testing, and secure authentication.

The project is still under active development as I continue adding new modules and improving API structure.
